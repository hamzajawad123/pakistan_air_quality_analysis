# 🌫️ Pakistan Air Quality Analysis (2024–2025)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a statistical analysis of Pakistan’s air quality data to evaluate the severity and geographical distribution of hazardous smog across the country.

The study investigates whether air pollution is primarily a city-specific issue or a nationwide environmental risk by examining AQI levels and pollution patterns from multiple regions during 2024–2025.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate national air quality trends
- Assess frequency of unsafe AQI levels
- Compare pollution levels across regions
- Examine Lahore vs nationwide AQI distribution
- Identify contributing pollution factors
- Support data-driven environmental policy decisions
